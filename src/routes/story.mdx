# Story

Here I'll talk about some of the ways I organize my story and what it's about.

We try to organize the story in a structure that does a few things:

1. We want to have a knowledge database to generate keywords that can be mapped to summaries to use in ChatGPT (which my tool [UpGptNoiseFilter](tools) does for us since it parses files organized in folders of this specific structure).
2. The numeric naming structure for chapters is also used by many assets and gameplay tags within the game engine and helps keep things in order when listing out assets in alphanumeric order.
3. We can combine all the separate markdown pages into some giga notes in the "Combined Folder" which we can use in a ChatGPT project for context.
4. The actual story outline describes all the different dialogs in the game - some triggered via NPCs, in game events, or cutscenes.
5. The specific way the story is written mimics a script but it also has a special format which lets you copy paste stuff into the game's dialog system:

## Summary

Here's what I have so far. I think I've rewritten this origin overlying plot a few times but I think I like this one a lot and hopefully we stick with this idea.

The main conflict of this game is this giant coverup which led to the second iteration of humans granted no one on Earth knows humanity was extinct previously and were reborn.

The story takes place on modern day Earth but 50000 years ago humans were even more technologically advanced and in typical sci-fi fashion corporations were the most powerful things in the world.

But one day there was a giant magic tree that somehow came to earth from space Lavos style. It released a blue mist which had the potential to awaken magical powers in some humans, but it turned other humans and animals into monsters.

We call humans that awakened magic Ancients.

Magic was seen as an equalizer to many, while others wanted to destroy the tree to protect the world against monsters.

The tree was able to speak to those who utilized the Aurelius to use magic and eventually create his own personal cult of people by convincing people that it's role was to help save people from having to be slaves from corporations.

Secretly the tree was actually a construct created by divine beings in another world far away called the Ancient World to find beings to take part in some excruciatingly difficult trial called the Ortensia to find someone worthy enough to inherit divine will.

Eventually war broke out between people who wanted to rid the world of Aurelius and those who were followers of the tree. Eventually those who could wield the tree's power won and the other side decided to try to preserve pure humans by hatching an ultimatum.

The humans without magic decided to create cloning devices that would recreate society but at the medieval stage, and also give them some modifications that would hopefully help lead away from the corporate corruption that made them lose the war. These second iteration of humans are known as replicants.

The humans built purification machines as well and then obliterated the world with super weapons erasing all of history and monsters for the next 50000 years. In the meantime the purifiers would slowly make the world habitable again before the clones were created.

Before the tree could be obliterated it somehow teleported itself and many of its followers back to the Ancient World to finish its mission of bringing new beings to attempt the Ortensia. The catch is all followers must relinquish their memories in the process of being transported.

Fast forward to 50000 years later, the second iteration of humans are living in the modern day which seems to have its own set of corruption problems and in the Ancient World we have a few Ancients (originally human beings) who managed to still survive. There are many generations of Ancients who were born in this massive world who worship the tree and have no connection to Earth.

One of which is a very powerful lady who managed to scale very far in the Ortensia causing many others to consider her as a divine being. People know her by Divine Chaos, but she's lost much of her humanity for the sake of power. Thhe Ancient World is home to many powerful monsters from many realms like the Underworld, the demon realm, the kingdom of heaven, etc.

Though Divine Chaos never lost touch of her human roots at some point she'd managed to pass the trials to become an "Old One", or one of the rulers of the Demonic Realm.

She often observes the plans of other people who have traveled far into Ortensia, including the ruler of the Underworld, a being called Treasonous Soul who has killed many people and caused many wars in the Ancient World due to him becoming stronger the more souls he can gather from the dead.

Divine Chaos has little concern over the morality of Treasonous Soul's actions, but she does care about true judgment which is being able to do anything to bear your sins. That's her personal mantra, and she doesn't really impose it in others but it does explain why she's never too concerned about killing people to move forward on the mission:

This is a quote Divine Chaos mentions when her friend who hasn't had to kill anyone before feels great remorse having to make tough decisions on the mission.

> Perfection is a mirage people chase to justify doing nothing. If you kill to escape your own failures or satisfy your desire, that's sin. But to act in judgment - to do what no one else will because they're afraid to bear the weight of their own sins - is not imperfection - it's a burden. It's a necessary promise to do what no one else will - take responsibility.

Somehow before the Divine Tree left Earth it managed to leave some of it's roots deep below the surface. Those roots survived the doomsday weapons and still spies on humanity. It even has control over some of the replicants and can have people from its cult act on its behalf.

Somehow the tree finds out humans are starting to unravel this mystery about the Ancient World, and the tree decides it needs to destroy humanity for real before humans realize what occurred and possibly cause all the Ancients who worship it to possibly realize their origin and maybe lose allegiance.

The tree seeks out the help of Treasonous Soul who accepts the invitation to go to Earth and control humanity from the shadows and turn the world into his own personal soul farm. Granted Earth is so far away from the Ancient World which is the source of power for magic so even divine beings like Treasonous Soul will be much weaker. But he's still strong enough to destroy entire armies and he has his own army of Undead known as the Ascendancy to help him.

Meanwhile DivineChaos is on her own mission looking for an artifact known as the Mirage Gem which is associated with being able to distort time. This is when the prologue of the game I made occurs, where you play as Horola which is Divine Chaos disguised as a newbie who is asking people around in this remote village about the gem. Eventually DivineChaos finds out it's in this nearby quarry guarded by extremely powerful monsters, and she also finds that the Ascendants are looking for it too.

DivineChaos traverses the quarry and finds one the Ascendant generals who knows he's much weaker than her so he kind of summons an extremely powerful monster to distract DivineChaos then escapes before she can kill him. But he leaves behind a message from his boss about their plans to go to Earth.

DivineChaos researches the technique to arrive at this place and does some investigating about Earth. She finds out this is a battleground where magic won't be as powerful, which excites her greatly. She's never been a big fan of fighting divine beings since everyone is so powerful the battles lack any technique since everyone just can blow up planets in half so you have to find some crazy creative strategies that have never been seen to win.

DivineChaos eventually manages to arrive on Earth and she witnesses Treasonous Soul and his army which he slowly summons over since it takes a lengthy and expensive ritual to transport things between world slowly taking over the planet from the shadows. DivineChaos isn't interested in saving humanity but she's very dedicated to killing all Ascendants to get some experience to help her go further in Ortensia.

And that's where the story mostly begins. The origin is revealed over time, but you play as Cyphina who is some guy just going to school when his bus gets stuck in a tunnel where the Ascendants are going to use everyone inside as sacrifices for their ritual to summon a monster. Before they can do it DivineChaos releases Aurelius into the tunnel which looks like a nerve agent. That turns everyone into monsters and causes everyone to kill each other to prevent them from being sacrificed. Cyphina somehow manages to be the last monster alive since his monster form isn't completely insane but it seems to be composed and works alongside him.

Ever since that day Cyphina has been panicking about being taken in by the police but he also tries to piece the mystery of what happened together. He ends up being caught in another plan of DivineChaos but he realizes he saw this woman back during the whole tunnel incident and confronts her about being an Ancient who is trying to play with human lives. DivineChaos introduces herself as Sephielle and at first pretends not to know much but acts like someone caught up in the greater conspiracy. Cyphina follows her not to figure out the mystery behind this world conspiracy, but because he's lonely since it's hard to connect with people when you're a monster who the blood of other people on their hands. Eventually Sephielle sees some kind of potential in Cyphina and tells him the greater truth about what's going on, and Cyphina slowly gets more involved since helping Sephielle brings meaning to his life and he feels like Sephielle's wisdom is making him stronger.

That's the jist of the story. It's told as episodes of Cyphina helping Sephielle in missions, and Cyphina also has some dreams of occurances 7 years in the future which manifest as mission in the game where you play as someone named Zone who deals with problems in the future timeline which can provide information to Cyphina about how to deal with issues in the past.

To close the summary, i'd say that one of the main themes of this story that surrounds Sephielle is this idea of true divinity:

Most humans think divinity means:

1. Being powerful enough to control others
2. Eternal legacy
3. Immortality
4. Moral Purity

To Sephielle:

1. Power is transient. It's a tool, not to be clung onto. Sephielle's divine powers are also a byproduct of not obsessing over these aspects divinity, only focusing on controlling one's fate.
2. Chasing legacy is weakness because Sephielle values clarity and not depending on wavering external systems.
3. Chasing immortality is weakness because it means fearing death and value of fleeting time.
4. Moral purity prevents grounded actions.

A lot of the story is about Sephielle using her weaker clone Sephielle Zeta to go on mission with Cyphina. Together they aren't very strong, but Sephielle's philosophy helps them stay focused and fight those who are much stronger by trying to take advantage of their weakness in mentality. Sephielle never tells Cyphina what to think, but being around her Cyphina is able to observe this idea of true divinity to learn what separates a divine being like Sephielle from a human. At first Cyphina thinks it's how powerful she is, but as he fights along her weaker clone Sephielle Zeta he realizes the power to control ones fate is what sets her apart. Because power is just a tool to that means, but it's only one tool in Sephielle Zeta's wide knowledge and discipline which lets her abuse people even much stronger.
