# Story

Here I'll talk about some of the ways I organize my story and what it's about.

We try to organize the story in a structure that does a few things:

1. We want to have a knowledge database to generate keywords that can be mapped to summaries to use in ChatGPT (which my tool [UpGptNoiseFilter](tools) does for us since it parses files organized in folders of this specific structure).
2. The numeric naming structure for chapters is also used by many assets and gameplay tags within the game engine and helps keep things in order when listing out assets in alphanumeric order.
3. We can combine all the separate markdown pages into some giga notes in the "Combined Folder" which we can use in a ChatGPT project for context.
4. The actual story outline describes all the different dialogs in the game - some triggered via NPCs, in game events, or cutscenes.
5. The specific way the story is written mimics a script but it also has a special format which lets you copy paste stuff into the game's dialog system:

## Summary
  
TODO... I've rewritten the main plotline a few times and I need to make a better summary of my latest idea.
