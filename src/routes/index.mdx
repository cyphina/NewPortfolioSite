# Unbounded Perceptions 
        
## Welcome to my Site!

<Main />

Hi it's Zi here. Welcome to my side I made with Solid-Start and MDX. My [old site](agitated-lalande-f97eb6.netlify.app/) (dunno if it's gonna be up forever) was made in Svelte 3 so I just had to like do some upgrades...

Thanks to my pal Asim for teaching me how to make the site look ok in mobile. There's definitely more work to do but uhh yeah I have to like also do my own projects, study, take care of people, ya know everything you probably do better than me.

I've been working on one game solo for the last around seven years on my free time. The concept you can see in the [game](/game) section, but it's inspired by stuff like ORPGs in WC3 and Siltbreaker in Dota.

>**If you want to read about how the systems in this game are built - from cutscene scripting to multiplayer dialog to AI and vision threading - check out the <A href="/technical docs">technical docs</A>  section. It covers architecture behind key features I implemented in C++, Blueprints, and AngelScript, with an emphasis on system design, narrative tooling, and player facing flexibility.**

I've also worked professional in the games industry the last 4 years. The game was an third-person shooter MMO and I worked as UI Engineer typically on the UI framework like making core components, layout systems, focus navigation, animated gain/loss bars, etc. Even though the game got canceled hopefully this work gets ported to ESO and some addon creators can enjoy it.

Occasionally I also built UIs from design specs like something similar to the marvel rivals healthbar, nameplates, or activity trackers.

Besides programming I usually play RPG games. Stuff like Star Ocaen Second Story R, and Treasure of the Rudras. But my favorite game is probably Dota 2, and I play a decent amount of PVE custom games.

I guess it's a good time to introduce my objectives with my game Unbounded Perception. You can find more about the core game loop [here](/game) I don't really care about making money with it, but I do want to:

1. Make a game I would like to play one day
2. Tell an interesting story that portrays some interesting perspectives on the world and hopefully boosts the creative IQ of someone who plays. Something like [Despiria](https://youtu.be/de-8Vz5Ng0A?si=nC69ojDE1z9fNgi-).
    1. The story is episodic so we had to build some systems to kind of make levels dynamic. You visit a level for a "reason" and based on that "reason" the level changes how it looks. The reasons are things like ok well this place was visited by Bob at like Tuesday. Then you can revisit some place from Joe's perspective on like Saturday.
    2. That whole system is tied together through the level picking system that was influenced by devil survivor.

3. Really make the player suffer and troll them cause in Dota 2 you see people going OP builds too much in PVE. 
    1. I want to leverage what I've seen there and make sure all types of players will suffer cause it'll be funny.
    2. But honestly I want people to have to be creative in their gameplay too instead of just playing some ranged carry shooting from the backline or just kiting everything with spells.
4. Be able to make every single interaction in Dota 2. But have a nicer way to build all the content needed for a PVE mode.
    1. I'd say I've managed to succeed in this front. Cause my scope is larger than Siltbreaker in terms of what our game can provide from a PVE standpoint, but it's also like the scope of the overall game is smaller since I built it in a way such that it's easier to create things but you don't have the flexiblity of like having enemies in multiple teams (at least not as easily).
        1. For example AI logic in Dota is like a loop written in Lua. I really worked hard to setup nodes for our system to do things like follow players when you run out of vision all while minimizing the number of nodes you use in the graph. There are also custom nodes to react to events and break out of the traditional looping logic of the behavior tree or transition to new trees.
