Hi, it's Zi, a solo game dev here working on my game Up (**Unbounded Perceptions**). Welcome to my site I made with Solid-Start and MDX. My <A href="http://agitated-lalande-f97eb6.netlify.app">old site</A> (it'll probably stop working one day) was made in Svelte 3.

Here's the normie elevator pitch description of Up: 

>“Unbounded Perceptions is like Live A Live’s episodic story meets a Dota 2 PvE custom game — but slower-paced and strategic, where you control up to 4 heroes at once and every fight is about adapting your builds and figuring out a strategy with whatever cast of characters you have for an episode, not just dodging.”

I also made up a new genre called **PETRPG** to help describe Up. 

- Party: Control up to 4 distinct heroes in real-time. The story shifts your roster, forcing you to adapt to new team dynamics while still carrying forward familiar faces that you build up throughout the story.
- Episodic: The narrative unfolds in branching episodes. The player has a list of events, and events from various points in time pop up as you progress or interact with things in the world. Each event might have different game modes and have a different set of the main characters interacting with side characters.
- Tactical: I think strategy games have some element of macro play, like building a base and figuring out the best build to counter your opponent. In Up, there's still the decision-making of picking the best gear that protects against elements the enemy will use and finding the best skills to counterplay the enemy. But in general, you have to optimize for the next encounter you face instead of having to think long term.
