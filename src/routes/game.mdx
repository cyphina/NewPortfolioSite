        # Game
    
        This page (and eventually its subpages) has information about the game I've been working on the last four years.
        This is the game from which I taught myself most of what I know about programming and learning the ins and out
        of UE4.
    
        Before I talk about my game and showcase a gallery component, I would like to list the tutorials which this game
        is based off of. Of course since I've been working on it for so long, I have more features than those tutorials
        and I have expanded upon the tutorial's features as well.
    
        1. [Visual Basic Game Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/Aardaerimus) - this youtube channel Aardaerimus is where I started it all
        2. [Unity RTS Tutorial](http://www.stormtek.geek.nz/) - This is the tutorial that I did in high school that started the Unbounded Perceptions journey after Visual Basic.
        3. [First Unreal Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aipoAphfAN8) - This is the first tutorial I watched in UE4

        These tutorials are definately the most inspiring for me. They taught me a lot about the engines I used and they
        were really fun. However, for learning technique, I would read/watch different tutorials and read a few books I
        may list somewhere else. But you gotta have some inspiration first if you wanna do things for the long run am I
        right? (my teacher always asked that)

        Now here are the screenshots for my game. Looking back at these pics I've created so many user interfaces, but
        I'm definately not a UI specialist. Just have to create things for the game.
