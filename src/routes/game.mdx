        # Game
    
        This page (and eventually its subpages) has information about the game I've been working on the last seven years part time. Think we started in Unreal version like 4.12 or earlier, so you know I've done many migrations...

        Recently I updated the fork I use of Unreal-AngelScript from 5.4 to 5.6 and had to fix some plugins I used like NotYet's [dialog system](https://github.com/NotYetGames/DlgSystem). Shoutout to them for the great work - I couldn't just like grab their latest code since I had too many modifications to support some stuff in my game like my own trigger and conditional system.

        It's basically taking the ORPG formula but I wanted to make the game tell an episodic story so we steal like being able to pick many different locations based on the quests you have available plus the locations you've unlocked at a part of the story or from doing sidequests and stuff.

        The world is very dynamic cause I have this special "Event Flag" system to make levels change depending on the reason you visit them. That's how we support this episodic story, since everytime you pick a location to visit you're typically picking it from a list that shows the quests you're visiting the location for.

        And depending on that quest the place you visit will change how it looks a bit. To be honest it's not like how it looks, it's more like what's there cause I suck nuts at making things look good. I'm more concerned about making things fun so yeah we're going to have to get some help for the looking part...

        This is the game from which I taught myself most of what I know about programming and learning the ins and out
        of UE4.

        Before I talk about my game and showcase a gallery component, I would like to list the tutorials which this game
        is based off of. Of course since I've been working on it for so long, I have more features than those tutorials
        and I have expanded upon the tutorial's features as well.

        1. [Visual Basic Game Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/Aardaerimus) - this youtube channel Aardaerimus is where I started it all
        2. [Unity RTS Tutorial](http://www.stormtek.geek.nz/) - This is the tutorial that I did in high school that started the Unbounded Perceptions journey after Visual Basic.
        3. [First Unreal Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aipoAphfAN8) - This is the first tutorial I watched in UE4
