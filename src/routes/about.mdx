# About Me

Hey I am Nam Ha aka Zi. I think the roles I play most are as a developer, designer, and writer. I like developing systems for games, sometimes things designed by others like when I was a UI programmer. I also like making tools to create things more efficiently for games with an emphasis on gameplay assets (creating AIs, enemy data, spells, etc.). 

In my personal time I like designing some ideas for a game - particularly thinking about what would make a fight interesting. I wouldn't say I'm a good designer who tries make some popular system, but I think since I'm someone who has really practiced games for competition who has evolved into a casual gamer who plays with their friends in their free time, I can make something that's challenging, incites creativity, and trolls the player.

I've been writing stories since I was in elementary school since I really enjoy it. I wish I could do it more but it's quiet time consuming cause I evolved from making many shorter stories to wanting to make one large good one. I think talking with AI has helped with my writers block but it takes a lot of work to perfect the dialog from the level of the collective ideas of AI to the standards I developed after writing and talking to some interesting people. I think I might have thousands of pages of ideas in conversations with ChatGPT but I've maybe only transcribed 100-200 pages of script that I would consider acceptable - and sometimes I even go back and revise them as I come up with better ideas.

# About Unbounded Perceptions

## Game

The game plays like a blend between Dota 2 and Warcraft 3, minus the base-building.
You control a small squad of up to four stylistically distinct heroes in real-time, each with their own set of skills and strategic utility.
Combat is tactical, skill-based, and pattern-driven—you’re not just dealing damage, you’re learning enemy behavior, adapting your tactics, and finding synergy between your units.

Instead of a massive open world, the game is broken into self-contained scenarios, like episodes in a serialized anime or drama.
Each one takes place at a specific moment in the story and gives you a fixed set of heroes based on who’s active in that arc.
The scenarios branch narratively and mechanically, and the player can tackle them in different orders, leading to non-linear storytelling—including past memories, alternate perspectives, or simultaneous plotlines playing out in different locations.

Over time, your scenario board grows—main missions, side episodes, character-focused stories—all expanding organically as you progress.

The heart of the gameplay isn’t grinding or optimizing stat numbers—it’s about understanding your heroes, seeing the big picture, and adapting your approach with limited but meaningful tools.

## Narrative

What makes the game stand out isn’t just the combat—it’s how the gameplay reflects the themes of the story.

The narrative centers around characters like Sephielle, a divine battle tactician whose philosophy revolves around clarity, emotional resilience, and responsibility.
She’s not powerful because of brute strength—she’s powerful because she sees the truth, cuts through distractions, and adapts with absolute precision.

That same idea flows into how you play:

You’re not expected to grind endlessly or build perfect characters.

Instead, you’re rewarded for reading situations, staying calm under pressure, and finding strategies that hold up under changing conditions.

Boss fights, for example, are like moral puzzles wrapped in mechanics. Each encounter challenges how well you understand your team—not just their skills, but their role in the broader picture.
There’s no “meta.” There’s only: what works here, and now?

The game encourages you to think like Sephielle—not chasing power or perfection, but seeking clarity, consistency, and the strength to act even when the odds aren’t in your favor.

Over time, you’re not just watching characters evolve—you’re evolving too.
You start out just trying to win fights, but as the story unfolds, and the mechanics challenge your assumptions, you start to internalize the philosophy behind the missions.
It’s a story about judgment, responsibility, and what it really means to control your own fate—told not just in words, but through every decision you make on the battlefield.
