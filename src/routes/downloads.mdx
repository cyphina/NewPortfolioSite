    # Game
    
    Here's the <A href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DWw_bENILRa3-dXPbbT7-QQwSy8bmpDF/view">download link</A> for the game.

    The contents of the link has a zip file (called `Windows.7z` since it's a packaged Windows shipping build) and there's a folder with an executable `MyProject.exe` you have to run to play the game.

    Still fixing a lot of bugs with it especially since I haven't tested the shipping build very much. Especially some bugs surrounding like cutscenes, save/load, quitting, etc.

    There's even some bugs with AI I found in a standalone development build I'm still fixing.

    Also a lot of UX improvements to be made but if you play it you can technically see everything I made in the video.
