## Technical Features Breakdowns

Here we'll link pages to some writeups about the different features I made. Some of these pages are a work in progress.

The breakdowns usually talk more about the design (focusing a lot on UX) cause the C++ code isn't too technical for veterans. The hardest part is since there are so many areas involved you need to understand the Unreal source code for all these spots at a decent level. Also I don't share the code cause I'm trying to keep some techniques to myself - ya know I worked hard to learn, design, and research all the concepts but if you contact me via the [contact info](/contact) I'm down to share code and help.

### Dynamic World And Narrative Tech

Here's some docs about how to make some simple interfaces for designers to be able to create dynamic levels story based content in Unreal.

* <A href="/technical docs/event">Data Driven Primitives and Event Flags - Data Driven Approach to Dynamic Levels</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/cutscenes">Narraration - How I played Star Ocean Second Story to Figure out Cutscene Requirements and Extended the Sequencer</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/dialog">Dialog Systems and NPCs - Extending Not Yet Dialog System and Handling Multiplayer</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/quests">Quest System (and a bit of dialog) - Custom Details versus Quest Graph</A>

### Gameplay Tech

Here are docs about various gameplay systems where I try my best to explain how I tried to design the simplest interfaces to make content for systems that have a lot of interactions.

* <A href="/technical docs/vision">Vision System - Multithreaded Stuff with Vision Groups, Weak Pointers, and `TQueue`</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/items">Item System - Relational Tables</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/ai">AI - Reactive Behaviors</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/characterMovement">Character Movement - Flocking, Custom Movement Component and Interactable Use Positioning</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/spells">Spell System - An ability system inspired by some of my favorite games Dota 2 and Sonny 2</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/assetCreation">Asset Creation - AngelScript Editor Widget</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/multiplayer">Refactoring a Single Player Game to Multiplayer - I couldn't play my game for like a month during this...</A>

### CMake Stuff

I'm not very well versed on all the techs used to build C++ or JavaScript projects. But I did learn about one part - CMake aka the buildsystem generator. I learned it because... well it helped me improve my own C++ programming skills but also I found a good book <A href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Modern-CMake-for-Cpp-2E">Modern CMake for CPP</A>.

* <A href="/technical docs/cmakealgorithms">A nice set of CMakeLists to Setup an Environment to Practice Algorithms</A>

### UI Stuff

A lot of my UI work was in C++/JavaScript in a custom UI framework for the canceled MMORPG shooter project that people online call "Blackbird". 

I can't post pictures of that since it's proprietary but I can talk about some techs I took from the game and incorporated in my own projects.

These are less of technical docs and more of showcases cause I'm not trying to solve some novel in these documents.

* <A href="/technical docs/upgptnoisefilter">An overview of a Custom ChatGPT frontend I made in React</A>
* <A href="/technical docs/uimanagement">An overview of the UIs built in Up</A>
