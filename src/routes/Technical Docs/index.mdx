## Technical Features Breakdowns

Here we'll link pages to some writeups about the different features I made. Some of these pages are a work in progress.

The breakdowns usually talk more about the design (focusing a lot on UX) cause the C++ code isn't too technical for veterans. The hardest part is since there are so many areas involved you need to understand the Unreal source code for all these spots at a decent level. Also I don't share the code cause I'm trying to keep some techniques to myself - ya know I worked hard to learn, design, and research all the concepts but if you contact me via the [contact info](/contact) I'm down to share code and help.
