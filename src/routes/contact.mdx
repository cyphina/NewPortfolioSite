      1. For friendly chat - cyphina@gmail.com 2. For something business
      oriented - z.nam.ky.ha@gmail.com 3. For something you want me to see 100%
      - ping `cyphinalyena` on Discord Launcher 4. To see my projects: [click
      here](https://github.com/cyphina/UnboundedPerceptions) 1. My RTS project I
      have there is super out of date. I have updated the code and fixed many
      paradigms. Since I worked really hard on it I moved it to a private repo
      to prevent it from being stolen or used for AI. 2. Another notable project
      I have is on Gitlab. This is my React custom ChatGPT frontend I made 2
      years ago [here](https://gitlab.com/uperception/upgpt-noise-filter) and a
      project where I practice algorithms trying to use C++23 techniques is
      [here](https://gitlab.com/z.nam.ky.ha-group/z.nam.ky.ha-algopractice).
